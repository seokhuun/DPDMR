# DPDMR: Disentangled Prototype-guided Dynamic Memory Replay for Continual Learning in Acoustic Signal Classification

[**Read the Paper on IEEE Xplore**](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10719982)

## Overview
DPDMR (Disentangled Prototype-guided Dynamic Memory Replay) framework addresses the challenges of catastrophic forgetting and efficient memory utilization in continual learning environments. It dynamically selects and updates stored samples based on their complexity and informational value, using a Triplet Network for disentangled representation learning. This helps the model retain challenging and informative samples while reducing redundancy.
