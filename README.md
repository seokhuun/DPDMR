# DPDMR: Disentangled Prototype-guided Dynamic Memory Replay for Continual Learning in Acoustic Signal Classification

[**Read the Paper on IEEE Xplore**](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10719982)

## Overview
Disentangled Prototype-guided Dynamic Memory Replay (DPDMR) enhances memory replay for continual learning in acoustic signal classification by prioritizing complex and informative samples. Through disentangled representation learning, DPDMR constructs prototypes that improve memory efficiency and mitigate catastrophic forgetting, resulting in superior performance even under limited memory conditions.
